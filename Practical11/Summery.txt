The alignment score of DLX5_human and DLX5_mouse is -20 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 96.55%
The alignment score of DLX5_human and random sequence is -314 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 3.10%
The alignment score of DLX5_mouse and random sequence is -314 and the percentage of identical amino acids is 3.45%

These results are obtained by running the program. By comparing the scores, it can be concluded that the three sequences are far 
related to each other. However, the alignment score of DLX5_human and DLAX5_mouse was larger than the score of their respective and
 random sequences, indicating that the genetic relationship of DLX5_human and DLAX5_mouse was larger than their respective and
 random sequences. At the same time, we can see that the percentage of identical amino acids in DLX5_human and DLX5_mouse is high,
and there may be a distant genetic relationship. However,  the percentage of identical amino acids in DLX5_human and random sequence
 or DLX5_mouse and random sequence is very low, and the genetic relationship could not be obtained.
